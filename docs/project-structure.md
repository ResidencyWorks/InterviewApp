# Project Structure Documentation

This document is maintained by the Project Structure Review feature.

- Directories analyzed: `src/`, `app/`, `supabase/`, `scripts/`
- Naming conventions: files kebab-case, classes PascalCase
- Architecture: Onion Architecture (domain independent of frameworks)

Update cadence: after each structure analysis run.
