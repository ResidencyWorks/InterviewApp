# Performance Testing Guide

## Overview

This document outlines the performance testing strategy for the Interview Drills application, including load testing, performance benchmarks, and stress testing procedures.

## Performance Testing Strategy

### 1. Load Testing

Load testing simulates normal expected usage patterns to ensure the system can handle typical user loads.

#### Objectives
- Verify system performance under normal load
- Identify performance bottlenecks
- Validate response time requirements
- Ensure system stability

#### Test Scenarios
- **Health Check**: Basic system health verification
- **Authentication**: Login and callback flows
- **Evaluation API**: Text and audio response evaluation
- **Content Pack API**: Content retrieval and management
- **User Profile**: Profile management operations

#### Performance Targets
- **Response Time**: 95% of requests < 500ms, 99% < 1s
- **Error Rate**: < 1%
- **Throughput**: 100+ requests/second
- **Concurrent Users**: 100+ simultaneous users

### 2. Performance Benchmarks

Performance benchmarks establish baseline performance metrics and track performance over time.

#### Baseline Performance
- **10 concurrent users** for 5 minutes
- **50 concurrent users** for 3 minutes
- **100 concurrent users** for 2 minutes

#### Peak Performance
- **150 concurrent users** for 2 minutes
- **200 concurrent users** for 1 minute

#### Key Metrics
- **HTTP Request Duration**: p95 < 500ms, p99 < 1s
- **Evaluation API**: p95 < 2s
- **Authentication API**: p95 < 300ms
- **Content API**: p95 < 500ms

### 3. Stress Testing

Stress testing pushes the system beyond normal capacity to identify breaking points and failure modes.

#### Objectives
- Identify system breaking points
- Test system behavior under extreme load
- Validate error handling and recovery
- Determine maximum capacity

#### Test Progression
- **50 users** → **100 users** → **150 users** → **200 users** → **250 users** → **300 users** → **350 users** → **400 users** → **450 users** → **500 users**

#### Stress Test Thresholds
- **Response Time**: p95 < 2s, p99 < 5s
- **Error Rate**: < 5%
- **System Recovery**: Automatic recovery after load reduction
