## Implementation

### 1. Audit Service Integration

#### Basic Usage
```typescript
import { auditService } from '@/lib/compliance/audit-service';

// Log an audit event
await auditService.logAuditEvent({
  userId: 'user-123',
  action: 'data_access',
  resourceType: 'user_profile',
  resourceId: 'profile-456',
  category: 'data_access',
  severity: 'low',
  outcome: 'success',
  details: {
    fields: ['name', 'email'],
    reason: 'profile_view'
  }
});
```

#### Middleware Integration
```typescript
// Express middleware for automatic audit logging
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  const originalSend = res.send;

  res.send = function(data) {
    // Log the request
    auditService.logAuditEvent({
      userId: req.user?.id,
      action: req.method.toLowerCase(),
      resourceType: req.route?.path,
      category: 'system',
      severity: 'low',
      outcome: res.statusCode < 400 ? 'success' : 'failure',
      ipAddress: req.ip,
      userAgent: req.get('User-Agent'),
      sessionId: req.sessionID,
      requestId: req.id
    });

    originalSend.call(this, data);
  };

  next();
});
```

### 2. Compliance Monitoring

#### Real-time Monitoring
```typescript
// Monitor compliance violations in real-time
auditService.on('violation', (violation) => {
  if (violation.severity === 'critical') {
    // Send immediate alert
    sendCriticalAlert(violation);
  } else if (violation.severity === 'high') {
    // Send high priority alert
    sendHighPriorityAlert(violation);
  }
});
```

#### Scheduled Compliance Checks
```typescript
// Run compliance checks every hour
setInterval(async () => {
  const violations = await auditService.getComplianceViolations({
    resolved: false,
    startDate: new Date(Date.now() - 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000) // Last 24 hours
  });

  if (violations.length > 0) {
    await sendComplianceReport(violations);
  }
}, 60 * 60 * 1000);
```

### 3. Reporting and Analytics

#### Compliance Reports
```typescript
// Generate monthly compliance report
const report = await auditService.generateComplianceReport(
  new Date('2024-01-01'),
  new Date('2024-01-31')
);

console.log('Compliance Report:', {
  totalEvents: report.summary.totalEvents,
  violations: report.summary.violations,
  resolvedViolations: report.summary.resolvedViolations,
  unresolvedViolations: report.summary.unresolvedViolations
});
```

#### Audit Log Analysis
```typescript
// Analyze audit logs for patterns
const logs = await auditService.getAuditLogs({
  category: 'authentication',
  startDate: new Date(Date.now() - 7 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000), // Last 7 days
  limit: 1000
});

// Analyze failed login attempts
const failedLogins = logs.filter(log =>
  log.action === 'login' && log.outcome === 'failure'
);

// Identify suspicious patterns
const suspiciousPatterns = analyzeLoginPatterns(failedLogins);
```

## Security Considerations
