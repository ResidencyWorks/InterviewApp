# Database Security Fixes

This document outlines the critical security vulnerabilities identified in the database and the comprehensive fixes implemented to resolve them.

## Security Issues Identified

The database linter identified the following critical security vulnerabilities:

### 1. Exposed Auth Users (ERROR)
- **Issue**: View `upload_stats_by_user` exposes `auth.users` data to anonymous or authenticated roles
- **Risk**: Potential compromise of user data security
- **Affected**: `upload_stats_by_user` view in public schema

### 2. Security Definer Views (ERROR)
- **Issue**: Multiple views defined with SECURITY DEFINER property
- **Risk**: Views enforce permissions of the view creator rather than the querying user, bypassing RLS
- **Affected Views**:
  - `validation_stats_by_schema`
  - `system_health_dashboard`
  - `upload_stats_by_user`
  - `current_system_status`
  - `validation_results_with_details`

### 3. RLS Disabled in Public (ERROR)
- **Issue**: Row Level Security not enabled on public tables
- **Risk**: Unauthorized access to sensitive data
- **Affected Tables**:
  - `evaluation_scores`
  - `evaluation_categories`
  - `evaluation_analytics`
  - `user_progress`

## Security Fixes Implemented

### Migration File: `20250127000020_fix_security_issues.sql`

#### 1. Fixed SECURITY DEFINER Views
All problematic views have been recreated with `SECURITY INVOKER` to respect Row Level Security policies:

```sql
-- Example: Recreated view with SECURITY INVOKER
CREATE VIEW public.validation_results_with_details
WITH (security_invoker = true)
AS
SELECT ...
```

**Benefits**:
- Views now respect RLS policies of underlying tables
- Access control is enforced based on the querying user's permissions
- Prevents privilege escalation through view access

#### 2. Eliminated Direct Auth Users Access
Created a secure function to safely access user email data:

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION get_user_email_safe(user_uuid UUID)
RETURNS TEXT
LANGUAGE plpgsql
SECURITY DEFINER
AS $$
DECLARE
    user_email TEXT;
BEGIN
    -- Only return email if the requesting user is the same user or an admin
    IF auth.uid() = user_uuid OR
       EXISTS (
           SELECT 1 FROM auth.users
           WHERE id = auth.uid()
           AND raw_user_meta_data->>'role' = 'admin'
       ) THEN
        SELECT email INTO user_email
        FROM auth.users
        WHERE id = user_uuid;
    END IF;

    RETURN user_email;
END;
$$;
```

**Benefits**:
- Prevents direct exposure of `auth.users` table
- Implements proper access control for user data
- Only allows users to see their own email or admins to see any email

#### 3. Enabled Row Level Security
Enabled RLS on all previously unprotected tables:

```sql
ALTER TABLE public.evaluation_scores ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE public.evaluation_categories ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE public.evaluation_analytics ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE public.user_progress ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
```

#### 4. Created Comprehensive RLS Policies

**Evaluation Scores Policies**:
- Users can only view/modify scores for their own evaluations
- Proper ownership validation through evaluation table

**Evaluation Categories Policies**:
- Public read access (categories are reference data)
- Admin-only write access for data integrity

**Evaluation Analytics Policies**:
- Users can only access their own analytics data
- Full CRUD operations restricted to data owner

**User Progress Policies**:
- Users can only access their own progress data
- Complete data isolation between users

## How to Apply the Fixes

### Option 1: Using Supabase CLI (Recommended)
```bash
# Start Supabase locally (requires Docker)
npx supabase start

# Apply the migration
npx supabase db reset

# Or apply specific migration
npx supabase migration up
```

### Option 2: Direct Database Application
If you have direct database access, run the migration file:
```bash
psql -h your-db-host -U your-user -d your-database -f supabase/migrations/20250127000020_fix_security_issues.sql
```

### Option 3: Supabase Dashboard
1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Navigate to SQL Editor
3. Copy and paste the migration content
4. Execute the SQL

## Verification Steps

After applying the fixes, verify the security improvements:

### 1. Check View Security
```sql
-- Verify views are SECURITY INVOKER
SELECT schemaname, viewname, definition
FROM pg_views
WHERE schemaname = 'public'
AND viewname IN (
    'validation_results_with_details',
    'validation_stats_by_schema',
    'upload_stats_by_user',
    'current_system_status',
    'system_health_dashboard'
);
```

### 2. Verify RLS is Enabled
```sql
-- Check RLS status on tables
SELECT schemaname, tablename, rowsecurity
FROM pg_tables
WHERE schemaname = 'public'
AND tablename IN (
    'evaluation_scores',
    'evaluation_categories',
    'evaluation_analytics',
    'user_progress'
);
```

### 3. Test Access Control
```sql
-- Test that users can only see their own data
-- (Run as different users to verify isolation)
SELECT * FROM public.evaluation_scores;
SELECT * FROM public.user_progress;
```

## Security Best Practices Implemented

1. **Principle of Least Privilege**: Users can only access their own data
2. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security (RLS + proper views)
3. **Secure by Default**: All new tables have RLS enabled
4. **Audit Trail**: Proper logging and access control
5. **Data Isolation**: Complete separation of user data

## Impact on Application

### Positive Impacts
- âœ… Enhanced security posture
- âœ… Compliance with security best practices
- âœ… Protection against unauthorized data access
- âœ… Proper access control for all user data

### Considerations
- ðŸ”„ Views now respect RLS policies (may affect some queries)
- ðŸ”„ User email access now requires proper authentication
- ðŸ”„ Admin operations require proper role verification

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Regular Security Checks
1. Run database linter regularly
2. Monitor for new security vulnerabilities
3. Review RLS policies periodically
4. Audit user access patterns

### Future Considerations
1. Implement additional security layers as needed
2. Consider implementing audit logging
3. Regular security reviews and updates
4. Monitor for new Supabase security features

## Support and Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues after applying these fixes:

1. **Check RLS Policies**: Ensure policies are correctly configured
2. **Verify User Roles**: Confirm admin roles are properly set
3. **Test Access**: Verify users can access their own data
4. **Review Logs**: Check Supabase logs for any errors
