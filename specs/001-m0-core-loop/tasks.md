## Path Conventions

- **Single project**: `src/`, `tests/` at repository root

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-5)**: Depends on Foundational phase completion
- **Polish (Phase 6)**: Depends on all user story completion

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 3 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories

### Within Each User Story

- API endpoints before UI components
- Services before components
- Core functionality before error handling
- Implementation before testing
- Story complete before moving to polish phase

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)
- All Polish tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- Different API endpoints can be created in parallel
- Different UI components can be created in parallel
- Different services can be created in parallel
- Different test files can be created in parallel

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Launch all API endpoint tasks together:
Task: "Create magic link login page in src/app/(auth)/login/page.tsx"
Task: "Create auth callback handler in src/app/(auth)/callback/route.ts"
Task: "Create Stripe webhook handler in src/app/api/webhooks/stripe/route.ts"

# Launch all component tasks together:
Task: "Implement authentication components in src/components/auth/"
Task: "Create protected route wrapper component"
Task: "Create user profile management"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (All User Stories P1)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (Authentication)
4. Complete Phase 4: User Story 2 (Evaluation)
5. Complete Phase 5: User Story 3 (Content Pack)
6. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test all user stories independently
7. Deploy/demo if ready

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (Auth MVP!)
3. Add User Story 2 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (Evaluation MVP!)
4. Add User Story 3 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (Content MVP!)
5. Add Polish phase ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
6. Each phase adds value without breaking previous phases

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1 (Authentication)
   - Developer B: User Story 2 (Evaluation)
   - Developer C: User Story 3 (Content Pack)
3. All stories complete and integrate independently

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [US1], [US2], [US3] labels map tasks to user stories for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Verify each story works independently before considering complete
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence

## Performance Targets

- **Authentication Flow**: ‚â§10 seconds from login request to authenticated access
- **Evaluation API**: ‚â§250ms for response evaluation
- **Content Pack Load**: ‚â§1 second for validation and hot-swap
- **Redis Lookups**: ‚â§50ms for entitlement checks
- **Page Load**: ‚â§2 seconds for drill interface

## Security Considerations

- Magic link authentication with secure token handling
- Protected routes with proper authorization checks
- Content pack validation to prevent malicious uploads
- API rate limiting and input validation
- Secure webhook handling for Stripe integration
- Environment variable security and validation
