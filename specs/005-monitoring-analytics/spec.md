# Feature Specification: Monitoring & Analytics

**Feature Branch**: `005-monitoring-analytics`
**Created**: 2025-01-27
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "# Feature Specification: Monitoring & Analytics"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

<!--
  IMPORTANT: User stories should be PRIORITIZED as user journeys ordered by importance.
  Each user story/journey must be INDEPENDENTLY TESTABLE - meaning if you implement just ONE of them,
  you should still have a viable MVP (Minimum Viable Product) that delivers value.

  Assign priorities (P1, P2, P3, etc.) to each story, where P1 is the most critical.
  Think of each story as a standalone slice of functionality that can be:
  - Developed independently
  - Tested independently
  - Deployed independently
  - Demonstrated to users independently
-->

### User Story 1 - Error Tracking and Monitoring (Priority: P1)

As an operator, I want all application errors to be automatically captured and logged so that I can quickly diagnose and resolve issues affecting users.

**Why this priority**: Error tracking is critical for system reliability. Without proper error monitoring, operators cannot identify or resolve issues, leading to poor user experience and potential data loss.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by triggering various error conditions and verifying they are captured in the monitoring system without requiring other features to be implemented.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a client-side error occurs, **When** the error is thrown, **Then** it is automatically captured and sent to Sentry
2. **Given** an API error occurs, **When** the error is thrown, **Then** it is captured with full context and sent to Sentry
3. **Given** a network failure occurs, **When** the request fails, **Then** the error is logged with retry information
4. **Given** a user encounters an error, **When** they report the issue, **Then** operators can find the error details in Sentry

---

### User Story 2 - User Behavior Analytics (Priority: P1)

As an operator, I want to track key user actions and behaviors so that I can understand how users interact with the application and identify areas for improvement.

**Why this priority**: Analytics provide essential insights into user behavior and feature usage. This data is crucial for making informed product decisions and measuring success.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by performing key actions and verifying analytics events are fired with correct metadata without requiring other features to be implemented.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user starts a drill, **When** they begin the session, **Then** a `drill_started` event is logged to PostHog
2. **Given** a user submits a response, **When** they complete the submission, **Then** a `drill_submitted` event is logged with context
3. **Given** a user receives evaluation results, **When** the score is returned, **Then** a `score_returned` event is logged with score data
4. **Given** a content pack is loaded, **When** the loading completes, **Then** a `content_pack_loaded` event is logged with version info

---

### User Story 3 - Secure Configuration Management (Priority: P2)

As a developer, I want monitoring and analytics configuration to be securely managed through environment variables so that sensitive data is protected and configuration is consistent across environments.

**Why this priority**: While not critical for core functionality, secure configuration management is essential for production deployments and prevents sensitive data exposure.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by verifying environment variables are properly loaded and used without exposing sensitive data in logs or client-side code.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a developer sets up the environment, **When** they configure monitoring tools, **Then** all sensitive keys are loaded from environment variables
2. **Given** the application starts, **When** monitoring tools initialize, **Then** they use the correct DSNs and tokens from environment config
3. **Given** a developer checks the configuration, **When** they review the setup, **Then** all required environment variables are documented in `.env.example`
4. **Given** sensitive data is accessed, **When** it's used in the application, **Then** it's never logged or exposed in client-side code

### Edge Cases

- What happens when Sentry is unavailable or returns errors?
- How does the system handle PostHog service outages or rate limiting?
- What happens when environment variables are missing or malformed?
- How does the system handle high-volume error logging without performance impact?
- What happens when analytics events are fired before user authentication?
- How does the system handle network failures during event transmission?
- What happens when sensitive data is accidentally included in error logs?
- How does the system handle analytics events with missing or invalid metadata?

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **ErrorEvent**: Represents an error captured by the monitoring system with context, stack trace, and metadata
- **AnalyticsEvent**: Represents a user action or system event logged to PostHog with user context and timestamp
- **MonitoringConfig**: Represents the configuration for monitoring services including DSNs, tokens, and environment settings

  These must be technology-agnostic and measurable.

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-01-27

- Q: How long should error logs and analytics data be retained, and what privacy controls are needed? → A: Standard retention (90 days errors, 1 year analytics) with user data anonymization after 30 days
- Q: What specific fallback behavior should occur when Sentry or PostHog services are unavailable? → A: Graceful degradation - buffer events locally, retry transmission when services recover
- Q: What specific context data should be included in analytics events beyond user ID and timestamp? → A: Essential context only (user ID, timestamp, event type, session ID, browser info)
- Q: Should different types of errors be classified by severity levels for better monitoring and alerting? → A: Detailed severity levels (critical, error, warning, info, debug) with manual classification
- Q: What specific performance thresholds should be maintained during high-volume monitoring operations? → A: Standard web performance (monitoring adds <50ms to API calls, <10ms to page loads)

## Assumptions

- Sentry and PostHog services will be available and responsive
- Environment variables will be properly configured in all deployment environments
- Users will have stable internet connections for event transmission
