# Research: Monitoring & Analytics

**Feature**: 005-monitoring-analytics
**Date**: 2025-01-27
**Purpose**: Resolve technical unknowns and establish implementation patterns

## Research Tasks

### 1. PostHog Integration Patterns

**Task**: Research PostHog integration patterns for Next.js applications with user context and session tracking

**Decision**: Use PostHog React SDK with Next.js integration, custom event tracking service, and user identification

**Rationale**:

- PostHog React SDK provides seamless integration with React/Next.js
- Custom event tracking service enables consistent event structure
- User identification ensures proper user journey tracking
- Session management provides context for analytics events

**Alternatives considered**:

- Direct PostHog API calls: More complex, less integrated
- Third-party analytics wrappers: Additional dependency and maintenance
- Custom analytics solution: More development time and maintenance

**Implementation details**:

- Use `posthog-js` and `posthog-node` packages
- Implement custom `AnalyticsService` with event validation
- Add user identification on authentication
- Implement session tracking with unique session IDs
- Add event buffering for offline scenarios

### 2. Sentry Integration for Full-Stack Applications

**Task**: Research Sentry integration patterns for Next.js full-stack applications with client and server error tracking

**Decision**: Use Sentry Next.js SDK with custom error boundaries, API route integration, and performance monitoring

**Rationale**:

- Sentry Next.js SDK provides automatic integration for both client and server
- Custom error boundaries catch React errors gracefully
- API route integration captures server-side errors
- Performance monitoring provides additional insights

**Alternatives considered**:

- Separate client/server Sentry instances: More complex configuration
- Custom error logging: More development time and less features
- No error tracking: Poor observability and debugging experience

**Implementation details**:

- Use `@sentry/nextjs` package with automatic instrumentation
- Implement custom error boundaries for React components
- Add Sentry middleware for API routes
- Configure performance monitoring and transaction tracking
- Implement error filtering and sensitive data scrubbing

### 3. Environment Variable Management and Validation

**Task**: Research environment variable management patterns for monitoring services with validation and security

**Decision**: Use Zod schemas for environment validation, centralized configuration service, and secure key management

**Rationale**:

- Zod provides runtime validation with TypeScript integration
- Centralized configuration prevents scattered environment access
- Secure key management prevents accidental exposure
- Validation ensures proper configuration on startup

**Alternatives considered**:

- Manual environment validation: Error-prone and inconsistent
- No validation: Runtime errors and poor developer experience
- Complex configuration management: Over-engineering for M0

**Implementation details**:

```typescript
const MonitoringConfigSchema = z.object({
  POSTHOG_API_KEY: z.string().min(1),
  POSTHOG_HOST: z.string().url().optional(),
  SENTRY_DSN: z.string().url(),
  SENTRY_ENVIRONMENT: z.enum(['development', 'staging', 'production']),
  NODE_ENV: z.enum(['development', 'production', 'test'])
});
```

### 4. Event Validation and Testing Patterns

**Task**: Research event validation and testing patterns for analytics and monitoring systems

**Decision**: Use Zod schemas for event validation, mock services for testing, and comprehensive test coverage

**Rationale**:

- Zod schemas ensure event structure consistency
- Mock services enable reliable testing without external dependencies
- Comprehensive test coverage prevents production issues
- Event validation prevents malformed data transmission

**Alternatives considered**:

- No event validation: Risk of malformed data and service errors
- Manual testing only: Inconsistent and error-prone
- Real service testing: Unreliable and expensive

**Implementation details**:

```typescript
const AnalyticsEventSchema = z.object({
  event: z.string().min(1),
  userId: z.string().optional(),
  sessionId: z.string().min(1),
  timestamp: z.string().datetime(),
  properties: z.record(z.any()).optional(),
  context: z.object({
    browser: z.string().optional(),
    os: z.string().optional(),
    device: z.string().optional()
  }).optional()
});
```

### 5. Performance Optimization for Monitoring

**Task**: Research performance optimization patterns for monitoring services to minimize impact on application performance

**Decision**: Use async event transmission, event batching, lazy loading, and performance monitoring

**Rationale**:

- Async transmission prevents blocking user interactions
- Event batching reduces API calls and improves performance
- Lazy loading reduces initial bundle size
- Performance monitoring ensures monitoring doesn't impact user experience

**Alternatives considered**:

- Synchronous event transmission: Blocks user interactions
- No performance optimization: Poor user experience
- Over-optimization: Increased complexity without significant benefit

**Implementation details**:

- Implement async event queuing with retry logic
- Batch events for efficient transmission
- Use dynamic imports for monitoring services
- Add performance monitoring to track monitoring overhead
- Implement circuit breakers for service failures

### 6. Graceful Degradation and Error Handling

**Task**: Research graceful degradation patterns for monitoring services when external services are unavailable

**Decision**: Use circuit breaker pattern, local event buffering, and graceful fallbacks

**Rationale**:

- Circuit breaker prevents cascading failures
- Local buffering ensures no data loss during outages
- Graceful fallbacks maintain application functionality
- Retry logic ensures eventual consistency

**Alternatives considered**:

- No fallback handling: Application failures during monitoring outages
- Complex retry mechanisms: Over-engineering for M0
- No buffering: Data loss during service outages

**Implementation details**:

- Implement circuit breaker with exponential backoff
- Use localStorage for client-side event buffering
- Implement server-side event queuing with Redis
- Add health checks for monitoring services
- Implement graceful degradation for UI components

### 7. Security and Privacy Considerations

**Task**: Research security and privacy patterns for monitoring and analytics to prevent sensitive data exposure

**Decision**: Use data scrubbing, PII filtering, secure transmission, and privacy-compliant data handling

**Rationale**:

- Data scrubbing prevents sensitive information leakage
- PII filtering ensures privacy compliance
- Secure transmission protects data in transit
- Privacy-compliant handling meets regulatory requirements

**Alternatives considered**:

- No data filtering: Privacy violations and compliance issues
- Over-filtering: Loss of valuable analytics data
- No security measures: Data exposure risks

**Implementation details**:

- Implement PII detection and filtering
- Use HTTPS for all data transmission
- Add data anonymization for long-term storage
- Implement data retention policies
- Add audit logging for data access

### 8. Debug and Development Tools

**Task**: Research debug and development tools for monitoring and analytics systems

**Decision**: Use debug flags, local event logging, development tools, and comprehensive logging

**Rationale**:

- Debug flags enable development-time event inspection
- Local event logging helps with debugging
- Development tools improve developer experience
- Comprehensive logging aids in troubleshooting

**Alternatives considered**:

- No debug tools: Difficult development and debugging
- Production-only monitoring: Poor development experience
- Over-complex debugging: Increased maintenance burden

**Implementation details**:

- Add `NEXT_PUBLIC_ANALYTICS_DEBUG` environment variable
- Implement local event logging in development
- Create development dashboard for event inspection
- Add comprehensive logging with different levels
- Implement event replay for testing
