# Implementation Plan: Monitoring & Analytics

**Branch**: `005-monitoring-analytics` | **Date**: 2025-01-27 | **Spec**: [link]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/005-monitoring-analytics/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

Enable comprehensive monitoring and analytics across the application using PostHog for event tracking and Sentry for error monitoring. Track critical events (drill_started, drill_submitted, score_returned, content_pack_loaded) with user context and session information. Implement secure configuration management through environment variables with validation, graceful degradation for service failures, and performance optimization to maintain sub-50ms API overhead.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: TypeScript 5.0+ with strict mode enabled
**Primary Dependencies**: PostHog, Sentry, Next.js 14, React, Node.js
**Storage**: PostHog for analytics data, Sentry for error logs, environment variables for configuration
**Testing**: Vitest for unit tests, Playwright for E2E tests, mock services for validation
**Target Platform**: Web application (frontend and API routes), Vercel deployment
**Project Type**: Web application (Next.js full-stack with monitoring integration)
**Performance Goals**: Monitoring adds <50ms to API calls, <10ms to page loads, 99% error capture within 5s
**Constraints**: Secure configuration, graceful degradation, no sensitive data exposure, comprehensive testing
**Scale/Scope**: M0 MVP with 3 user stories, 4 critical events, 2 monitoring services, comprehensive validation

**Structure Decision**: Onion Architecture with clear separation of concerns. Analytics and monitoring services are isolated in their own modules with domain independence. Configuration is centralized and validated. React hooks provide easy integration with UI components.
