# Tasks: Dev Environment & Tooling

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/004-dev-environment-tooling/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: Tests are OPTIONAL for this feature - focusing on development tooling setup rather than application testing.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

- **Single project**: `src/`, `tests/` at repository root
- **Configuration files**: `.devcontainer/`, `.vscode/`, root level config files
- **Scripts**: `scripts/` directory for development and CI scripts

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - Development Environment Setup (Priority: P1) üéØ MVP

**Goal**: As a developer, I want a reproducible local dev environment with linting, pre-commit hooks, and consistent tooling to ensure code hygiene.

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3)**: Depends on Foundational phase completion
- **Polish (Phase 4)**: Depends on User Story 1 completion

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories

### Within Each User Story

- Configuration files before scripts
- Scripts before documentation
- Core setup before validation
- Story complete before moving to polish phase

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)
- All Polish tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- Different configuration files can be created in parallel
- Different scripts can be created in parallel
- Documentation files can be created in parallel

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Launch all documentation tasks together:
Task: "Create comprehensive README.md with setup instructions"
Task: "Create CONTRIBUTING.md with development guidelines"
Task: "Create DEVELOPMENT.md with environment details"
Task: "Create HOOKS.md with git hook behavior documentation"

# Launch all configuration tasks together:
Task: "Configure pre-commit hooks for linting and formatting"
Task: "Configure pre-push hooks for type checking and testing"
Task: "Configure commit message validation for conventional commits"
Task: "Setup development scripts in package.json"
```

---

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently
5. Deploy/demo if ready

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (MVP!)
3. Add Polish phase ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
4. Each phase adds value without breaking previous phases

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: Documentation tasks
   - Developer B: Configuration tasks
   - Developer C: Script tasks
3. All tasks complete and integrate independently

---

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [US1] label maps task to User Story 1 for traceability
- User Story 1 should be independently completable and testable
- Verify setup works on fresh clone before considering complete
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence

## Performance Targets

- **Fresh Clone Setup**: ‚â§5 minutes from clone to running development server
- **Pre-commit Hooks**: ‚â§30 seconds for lint, format, and typecheck
- **Pre-push Hooks**: ‚â§2 minutes for full test suite execution
- **CI Pipeline**: ‚â§10 minutes for complete CI/CD pipeline execution
- **Docker Build**: ‚â§3 minutes for devcontainer image build

## Security Considerations

- Environment variables properly documented and validated
- No secrets committed to repository
- Git hooks prevent commits with sensitive data
- CI/CD pipelines use secure secret management
- Devcontainer runs with non-root user for security
