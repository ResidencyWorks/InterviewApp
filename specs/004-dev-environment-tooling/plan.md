# Implementation Plan: Dev Environment & Tooling

**Branch**: `004-dev-environment-tooling` | **Date**: 2025-01-27 | **Spec**: [link]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/004-dev-environment-tooling/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

Set up comprehensive developer environment and CI tooling with .devcontainer configuration, pnpm package management, Node.js LTS, Biome for linting/formatting, and VS Code extensions. Implement lefthook git hooks for pre-commit (lint, format, typecheck) and pre-push (full test suite). Enforce conventional commit formatting and provide complete .env.example with all required keys for Supabase, Stripe, PostHog, and Sentry. Generate testable dev setup that works on fresh clone with comprehensive README documentation.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: TypeScript 5.0+ with strict mode enabled
**Primary Dependencies**: Node.js LTS, pnpm, Biome, lefthook, Vitest, Playwright, VS Code extensions
**Storage**: File system for configuration files, .devcontainer for environment setup
**Testing**: Vitest for unit/integration tests, Playwright for E2E tests
**Target Platform**: Development environment (VS Code + devcontainer)
**Project Type**: Development tooling and CI/CD setup
**Performance Goals**: Fresh clone setup ≤5 minutes, pre-commit hooks ≤30s, pre-push hooks ≤2 minutes
**Constraints**: Must work on fresh clone, all tools must be containerized, conventional commits enforced
**Scale/Scope**: M0 MVP with complete dev environment, 4 git hooks, 1 devcontainer, comprehensive documentation

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

**Code Quality Gates:**

- [x] TypeScript strict mode enabled
- [x] Biome formatting and linting configured

- [x] JSDoc comments planned for all exported functions

**Architecture Gates:**

- [x] Onion Architecture pattern identified
- [x] Domain layer independence from frameworks confirmed
- [x] Interface adapters using DI pattern planned

**Testing Gates:**

- [x] Test-first approach planned
- [x] Vitest configuration planned
- [x] 80% coverage target set
- [x] Unit and integration test strategy defined

**Tooling Gates:**

- [x] pnpm as package manager confirmed
- [x] Devcontainer with Node.js LTS, Biome, lefthook planned
- [x] No ESLint/Prettier (Biome only)

**Performance Gates:**

- [x] Pre-commit hook performance targets defined (≤30s)
- [x] Pre-push hook performance targets defined (≤2 minutes)

**MCP Integration Gates:**

- [x] Context7 for specs/plans identified
- [x] Supabase for auth/storage/DB planned
- [x] Vercel for deployment planned
- [x] PostHog for analytics planned
- [x] Sentry for error tracking planned
