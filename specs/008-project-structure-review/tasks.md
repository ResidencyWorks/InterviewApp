# Tasks: Project Structure Review

**Feature**: 008-project-structure-review
**Date**: 2025-01-27
**Purpose**: Actionable task breakdown for comprehensive project structure analysis

## Summary

This task breakdown implements a comprehensive project structure analysis system that identifies duplicated functionality, structural inconsistencies, and provides actionable cleanup recommendations. The implementation follows a systematic approach with three user stories prioritized by impact and effort.

## Implementation Strategy

**MVP Scope**: User Story 1 (Comprehensive Project Structure Analysis) - provides immediate value by identifying all structural issues
**Incremental Delivery**: Each user story builds upon the previous, with User Story 2 validating consistency and User Story 3 providing actionable recommendations
**Parallel Opportunities**: Analysis tasks can run in parallel across different service categories (auth, analytics, content, database)

## Dependencies

**Story Completion Order**:
1. **User Story 1** (P1) - Must complete first as it provides the foundation analysis
2. **User Story 2** (P2) - Can start after US1 analysis is complete, validates consistency patterns
3. **User Story 3** (P3) - Depends on both US1 and US2, generates final recommendations

**Parallel Execution**: Within each story, different service categories can be analyzed in parallel.
