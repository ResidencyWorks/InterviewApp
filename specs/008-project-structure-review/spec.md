# Feature Specification: Project Structure Review

**Feature Branch**: `008-project-structure-review`
**Created**: 2025-01-27
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "I want to review the current layout, functions and files in @types/ @supabase/ @src/ @scripts/ @public/ @app/ and ensure that the project structure is correct and there is no duplicated functionilty or features"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Comprehensive Project Structure Analysis (Priority: P1)

As a **project maintainer**, I want to **analyze the entire project structure** so that I can **identify duplicated functionality, structural inconsistencies, and optimization opportunities** (target: reduce service duplication by 40%, decrease bundle size by 20%, improve code maintainability score by 50%).

**Why this priority**: This is foundational work that affects all other development activities. Identifying and resolving structural issues early prevents technical debt accumulation and improves maintainability.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by running automated analysis tools and manual review using checklist:
- [ ] Authentication services (4 files) analyzed and duplications identified
- [ ] Analytics services (4 files) analyzed and overlaps documented
- [ ] Content pack services (4 files) analyzed and validation logic compared
- [ ] Database services (3 files) analyzed and helper patterns reviewed
- [ ] Directory structure validated across @types/, @supabase/, @src/, @scripts/, @public/, @app/

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the project has multiple directories (@types/, @supabase/, @src/, @scripts/, @public/, @app/), **When** I analyze the structure, **Then** I should identify all duplicated functionality across these directories
2. **Given** there are multiple authentication services, **When** I review the auth implementations, **Then** I should identify which services are redundant and can be consolidated
3. **Given** there are multiple analytics implementations, **When** I analyze the monitoring services, **Then** I should identify overlapping functionality and recommend consolidation

### User Story 2 - Structural Consistency Validation (Priority: P2)

As a **developer**, I want to **ensure consistent architectural patterns** across the project so that I can **maintain code quality and reduce cognitive load** when working on different features.

**Why this priority**: Consistent patterns improve developer experience and reduce bugs. This supports the primary analysis by ensuring structural recommendations are implemented consistently.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by validating that similar functionality follows the same patterns (e.g., all services implement I{Name}Service interface, all use consistent error handling with Result<T> pattern), naming conventions are consistent (kebab-case for files, PascalCase for classes), and architectural decisions are applied uniformly (Onion Architecture with domain independence).

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** there are multiple service implementations, **When** I review the patterns, **Then** they should follow consistent interfaces and architectural patterns
2. **Given** there are multiple validation services, **When** I analyze the implementations, **Then** they should use consistent validation patterns and error handling

### User Story 3 - Documentation and Cleanup Recommendations (Priority: P3)

As a **project owner**, I want to **receive actionable recommendations** for structural improvements so that I can **prioritize cleanup efforts and technical debt reduction**.

**Why this priority**: Provides concrete next steps for improving the project structure. This completes the review process by delivering actionable insights.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by verifying that recommendations are specific, actionable, and prioritized by impact and effort.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** structural issues are identified, **When** I review the recommendations, **Then** they should include specific files to modify, consolidation strategies, and migration plans
2. **Given** there are unused or deprecated files, **When** I analyze the cleanup recommendations, **Then** they should identify safe removal candidates and dependencies

---

### Edge Cases

- What happens when there are circular dependencies between services?
- How does the analysis handle files that are imported but not actively used?
- What if there are conflicting architectural patterns in different parts of the codebase?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST analyze all directories (@types/, @supabase/, @src/, @scripts/, @public/, @app/) for structural patterns
- **FR-002**: System MUST identify duplicated functionality across authentication services (AuthService, ServerAuthService, AdminAuthService, ProtectedRoute)
- **FR-003**: System MUST identify duplicated functionality across analytics services (AnalyticsService, PostHogAnalyticsService, transcript-analytics, web-vitals)
- **FR-004**: System MUST identify duplicated functionality across content pack services (ContentPackService, ContentPackLoader, ContentPackValidator, content-pack-validation)
- **FR-005**: System MUST identify duplicated functionality across database services (DatabaseService, ServerDatabaseService, database helpers)
- **FR-006**: System MUST validate consistent architectural patterns across similar functionality
- **FR-007**: System MUST identify unused or deprecated files and dependencies
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide specific recommendations for consolidation and cleanup
- **FR-009**: System MUST prioritize recommendations by impact and implementation effort
- **FR-010**: System MUST document current project structure and identify structural inconsistencies

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **ProjectStructure**: Represents the overall organization of directories, files, and their relationships
- **ServiceDuplication**: Represents instances where similar functionality is implemented multiple times
- **ArchitecturalPattern**: Represents consistent patterns used across the codebase for similar functionality
- **CleanupRecommendation**: Represents specific actions to improve project structure

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: All duplicated services identified and documented with specific file locations and overlap analysis
- **SC-002**: Structural inconsistencies identified across all major directories with specific examples
- **SC-003**: Actionable recommendations provided for at least 5 major structural improvements
- **SC-004**: Unused files and dependencies identified with safe removal recommendations
- **SC-005**: Architectural pattern consistency validated across similar functionality areas
- **SC-006**: Project structure documentation updated to reflect current state and recommended improvements
