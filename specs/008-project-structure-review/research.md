# Research: Project Structure Review

**Feature**: 008-project-structure-review
**Date**: 2025-01-27
**Purpose**: Resolve technical unknowns and establish implementation patterns

## Research Tasks

### 1. Project Structure Analysis Methodology

**Task**: Research best practices for analyzing large codebases to identify duplicated functionality and structural inconsistencies

**Decision**: Use systematic directory traversal with pattern matching and dependency analysis

**Rationale**:

- Systematic approach ensures comprehensive coverage of all directories
- Pattern matching identifies similar functionality across different locations
- Dependency analysis reveals circular dependencies and unused code
- Manual review validates automated findings and provides context

**Alternatives considered**:

- Automated tools only: Less context and may miss business logic nuances
- Manual review only: Time-intensive and prone to human error
- Static analysis tools: May not capture architectural patterns effectively

**Implementation details**:

- Directory-by-directory analysis of @types/, @supabase/, @src/, @scripts/, @public/, @app/
- Pattern matching for similar service names and functionality
- Import/export analysis to identify dependencies
- Interface comparison to find duplicated contracts
- Manual validation of automated findings

### 2. Duplication Detection Patterns

**Task**: Research patterns for identifying duplicated functionality in TypeScript/JavaScript projects

**Decision**: Use interface comparison, function signature analysis, and import dependency mapping

**Rationale**:

- Interface comparison identifies services with similar contracts
- Function signature analysis finds methods with identical purposes
- Import dependency mapping reveals usage patterns and potential consolidation points
- File naming patterns help identify related functionality

**Alternatives considered**:

- Code similarity algorithms: May miss semantic duplicates with different implementations
- AST-based analysis: Complex and may not capture business logic intent
- Simple string matching: Too crude and prone to false positives

**Implementation details**:

- Compare service interfaces for overlapping functionality
- Analyze function signatures for identical method purposes
- Map import dependencies to identify usage patterns
- Group files by naming patterns and functionality
- Identify services that could be consolidated

### 3. Structural Consistency Validation

**Task**: Research approaches for validating architectural pattern consistency across large codebases

**Decision**: Use architectural pattern templates and consistency checking rules

**Rationale**:

- Pattern templates provide clear consistency criteria
- Consistency rules can be automated for validation
- Manual review ensures business context is preserved
- Documentation of patterns helps maintain consistency

**Alternatives considered**:

- Linting rules only: May not capture architectural patterns
- Manual review only: Inconsistent and time-intensive
- Automated architecture analysis: May miss business logic nuances

**Implementation details**:

- Define architectural pattern templates (Onion Architecture, DDD)
- Create consistency checking rules for each pattern
- Validate naming conventions across similar functionality
- Check interface consistency for similar services
- Verify error handling patterns are consistent

### 4. Cleanup Recommendation Prioritization

**Task**: Research methods for prioritizing structural improvements by impact and effort

**Decision**: Use impact-effort matrix with technical debt scoring

**Rationale**:

- Impact-effort matrix provides clear prioritization framework
- Technical debt scoring quantifies improvement value
- Risk assessment ensures safe cleanup recommendations
- Effort estimation helps with planning and resource allocation

**Alternatives considered**:

- Alphabetical ordering: Ignores impact and effort considerations
- Random prioritization: No systematic approach to improvement
- Impact-only prioritization: May recommend high-effort, low-value changes

**Implementation details**:

- Assess impact on maintainability, performance, and developer experience
- Estimate implementation effort (low/medium/high)
- Calculate technical debt score for each duplication
- Assess risk of breaking changes for each recommendation
- Prioritize high-impact, low-effort improvements first

## Research Summary

All technical unknowns have been resolved with concrete implementation decisions. The Project Structure Review will use:

1. **Systematic Analysis**: Directory-by-directory traversal with pattern matching
2. **Duplication Detection**: Interface comparison and dependency analysis
3. **Consistency Validation**: Architectural pattern templates and rules
4. **Prioritization**: Impact-effort matrix with technical debt scoring

These decisions align with the project constitution and provide a comprehensive, systematic approach to identifying structural improvements.

## Performance Targets

- **Analysis Completion**: <30 seconds for full project analysis
- **Accuracy**: 95% of duplications correctly identified
- **Coverage**: 100% of directories analyzed
- **False Positive Rate**: <5% for duplication detection

## Security Considerations

- Analysis is read-only and non-destructive
- No sensitive data exposed during analysis
- Recommendations preserve existing security patterns
- No changes to production code during review phase
