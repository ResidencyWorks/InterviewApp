# Feature Specification: Content Pack Loader

**Feature Branch**: `002-content-pack-loader`
**Created**: 2025-01-27
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "# Feature Specification: Content Pack Loader"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

<!--
  IMPORTANT: User stories should be PRIORITIZED as user journeys ordered by importance.
  Each user story/journey must be INDEPENDENTLY TESTABLE - meaning if you implement just ONE of them,
  you should still have a viable MVP (Minimum Viable Product) that delivers value.

  Assign priorities (P1, P2, P3, etc.) to each story, where P1 is the most critical.
  Think of each story as a standalone slice of functionality that can be:
  - Developed independently
  - Tested independently
  - Deployed independently
  - Demonstrated to users independently
-->

### User Story 1 - Upload and Validate Content Pack (Priority: P1)

As an admin user, I want to upload a content pack JSON file and have it validated before activation so that I can ensure the content is properly formatted and safe to load.

**Why this priority**: Content validation is critical for system stability. Without proper validation, malformed content packs could break the evaluation system, making this the most important user journey.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by uploading various JSON files (valid and invalid) and verifying validation behavior without requiring any other features to be implemented.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a developer accesses the content pack loader, **When** they drag and drop a valid JSON file, **Then** the system performs dry-run validation
2. **Given** a developer uploads an invalid JSON file, **When** validation fails, **Then** they receive descriptive error messages explaining what's wrong
3. **Given** a developer uploads a valid JSON file, **When** dry-run validation passes, **Then** they see a confirmation prompt to proceed with activation
4. **Given** a developer uploads a file with wrong format, **When** the system detects it's not JSON, **Then** they receive a clear error message about file format requirements

---

### User Story 2 - Hot-Swap Content Pack (Priority: P1)

As an admin user, I want to activate a validated content pack without redeploying the application so that I can update evaluation content quickly and efficiently.

**Why this priority**: Hot-swapping is the core value proposition of this feature. Without this capability, developers would need to redeploy the entire application for content updates, making this equally critical as validation.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by validating and activating a content pack, then verifying the new content is immediately available without requiring application restart.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a developer has validated a content pack, **When** they confirm activation, **Then** the content is hot-swapped in memory without app redeploy
2. **Given** a content pack is successfully loaded, **When** the system logs the event, **Then** PostHog receives the content_pack_loaded event with version and timestamp
3. **Given** a content pack is activated, **When** the evaluation system runs, **Then** it uses the new content pack data
4. **Given** a developer activates a new content pack, **When** the previous pack is replaced, **Then** the old content is cleanly removed from memory

---

### User Story 3 - Handle Fallback Content (Priority: P2)

As an admin user, I want to see a warning when no valid content pack is loaded so that I know the system is using fallback/default content.

**Why this priority**: While not critical for core functionality, this provides important operational visibility and helps developers understand the system state.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by starting the system without a content pack and verifying the fallback warning is displayed.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** no content pack is loaded, **When** a developer accesses the system, **Then** they see a UI banner indicating fallback content is being used
2. **Given** a content pack fails to load, **When** the system starts up, **Then** it falls back to default content and shows a warning banner
3. **Given** a developer sees the fallback warning, **When** they successfully load a content pack, **Then** the warning banner disappears

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a developer uploads a very large content pack file?
- How does the system handle concurrent content pack uploads from multiple developers?
- What happens when the content pack validation takes too long to complete?
- How does the system handle network failures during PostHog event logging?
- What happens when a content pack contains circular references or deeply nested structures?
- How does the system handle partial content pack uploads or corrupted files?
- What happens when the system runs out of memory during content pack loading?
- How does the system handle content pack activation while evaluations are in progress?

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **ContentPack**: Represents the JSON configuration file containing evaluation criteria, content, and metadata with versioned schema
- **ValidationResult**: Represents the outcome of content pack validation with success status and error details
- **LoadEvent**: Represents the logging event sent to PostHog when content pack is successfully loaded
- **ContentPackSchema**: Represents the Zod schema definition for content pack structure validation
- **UploadQueue**: Represents the queue management system for handling concurrent content pack uploads

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Define measurable success criteria.
  These must be technology-agnostic and measurable.

- **SC-003**: Content pack validation rejects 100% of malformed or invalid JSON files
- **SC-004**: PostHog logging succeeds for 99% of successful content pack loads with retry mechanism
- **SC-005**: Fallback warning UI appears within 2 seconds when no valid content pack is loaded
- **SC-006**: Content pack validation completes within 10 seconds for files up to 10MB

- **SC-008**: Error messages provide specific guidance for 95% of validation failures

## Assumptions

- Content packs will be provided in JSON format with a standardized schema
- Developers will have access to the content pack loader interface
- PostHog will be available for event logging
- The system will have sufficient memory to handle content pack hot-swapping
- Content pack files will be reasonably sized (under 10MB)
