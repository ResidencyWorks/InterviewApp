# Feature Specification: Mobile Performance & Transcript Response Optimization

**Feature Branch**: `006-mobile-performance-transcript-response`
**Created**: 2024-12-19
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Mobile load is fast; no layout shift. The app uses: Tailwind CSS with responsive design (grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-4), Proper mobile navigation (hidden md:flex), Next.js App Router with optimized loading. Need to verify actual mobile performance metrics. Transcript returns in <10s; no console errors/401s. Architecture supports this: Circuit breaker and retry logic implemented, Performance monitoring with 250ms target. Need to test actual Whisper API response times."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Fast Mobile App Loading (Priority: P1)

Mobile users can access the interview application quickly without experiencing layout shifts or performance issues that impact their ability to start interviews.

**Why this priority**: Mobile performance directly impacts user experience and interview success rates. Slow loading or layout shifts can cause users to abandon the app before starting interviews.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by measuring mobile app load times and Core Web Vitals on various mobile devices and network conditions, delivering immediate user experience improvements.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a mobile user opens the interview app, **When** the app loads, **Then** the initial page renders within 3 seconds on 3G networks
2. **Given** a mobile user navigates between pages, **When** page transitions occur, **Then** no layout shifts occur during loading
3. **Given** a mobile user on a slow network, **When** the app loads, **Then** responsive design adapts properly without breaking layout

### User Story 2 - Reliable Transcript Generation (Priority: P1)

Interview participants can generate transcripts of their interview sessions reliably within acceptable time limits without encountering system errors.

**Why this priority**: Transcript generation is a core feature that users depend on for interview review and analysis. Failures or long delays directly impact user satisfaction and feature adoption.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by submitting interview audio for transcript generation and measuring response times and error rates, delivering reliable transcript functionality.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user completes an interview session, **When** they request transcript generation, **Then** the transcript is returned within 10 seconds
2. **Given** a user requests transcript generation, **When** the system processes the request, **Then** no console errors or 401 authentication errors occur
3. **Given** a user requests transcript generation during high system load, **When** the request is processed, **Then** circuit breaker and retry logic ensure successful completion

### User Story 3 - Performance Monitoring & Optimization (Priority: P2)

The system continuously monitors performance metrics to ensure optimal user experience and can identify performance degradation before it impacts users.

**Why this priority**: Proactive monitoring enables early detection of performance issues and supports continuous optimization efforts.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by verifying that performance metrics are collected and monitored, delivering system reliability and optimization insights.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the system is running, **When** performance monitoring is active, **Then** mobile load times and transcript response times are tracked
2. **Given** performance metrics are collected, **When** thresholds are exceeded, **Then** appropriate alerts or optimizations are triggered
3. **Given** system performance data is available, **When** analysis is performed, **Then** optimization opportunities can be identified

### Edge Cases

- What happens when mobile users have very slow network connections (2G or poor WiFi)?
- How does the system handle transcript generation requests during peak usage periods?
- What occurs when the Whisper API experiences temporary outages or rate limiting?
- How does the app behave when mobile devices have limited memory or processing power?
- What happens when users switch between mobile and desktop during the same session?
