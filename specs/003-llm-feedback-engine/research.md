# Research: LLM Feedback Engine

**Feature**: 003-llm-feedback-engine
**Date**: 2025-01-27
**Purpose**: Resolve technical unknowns and establish implementation patterns

## Research Tasks

### 1. OpenAI API Integration Patterns

**Task**: Research OpenAI API integration patterns for TypeScript applications

**Decision**: Use official OpenAI Node.js SDK with structured error handling and retry logic

**Rationale**:

- Official SDK provides TypeScript support and automatic retries
- Built-in rate limiting and error handling
- Well-documented and maintained by OpenAI
- Supports both Whisper and GPT-4 APIs consistently

**Alternatives considered**:

- Direct HTTP calls: More control but requires manual error handling
- Third-party wrappers: Additional dependency and potential maintenance issues

**Implementation details**:

- Use `openai` npm package (latest version)
- Implement exponential backoff for retries
- Use structured error types for different failure modes
- Implement circuit breaker pattern for API failures

### 2. Onion Architecture for Framework-Agnostic Services

**Task**: Research Onion Architecture patterns for creating framework-agnostic services in TypeScript

**Decision**: Implement clean architecture with dependency inversion and interface segregation

**Rationale**:

- Domain layer contains pure business logic with no external dependencies
- Application layer orchestrates use cases and depends only on domain interfaces
- Infrastructure layer implements external concerns (OpenAI API, logging, etc.)
- Enables easy testing and framework swapping

**Alternatives considered**:

- Hexagonal Architecture: Similar benefits but more complex for this use case
- Layered Architecture: Simpler but creates tight coupling between layers

**Implementation details**:

- Domain entities: `Submission`, `Feedback`, `Score`
- Domain services: `FeedbackService`, `ScoringService`
- Application services: `EvaluateSubmissionUseCase`
- Infrastructure adapters: `OpenAISpeechAdapter`, `OpenAITextAdapter`

### 3. Retry and Fallback Patterns for External APIs

**Task**: Research retry and fallback patterns for external API integrations

**Decision**: Implement exponential backoff with jitter, circuit breaker, and graceful degradation

**Rationale**:

- Exponential backoff prevents overwhelming failing services
- Jitter reduces thundering herd problems
- Circuit breaker prevents cascading failures
- Graceful degradation maintains user experience

**Alternatives considered**:

- Simple retry: Insufficient for production reliability
- Fixed delay retry: Can cause thundering herd issues
- No fallback: Poor user experience during outages

**Implementation details**:

- Max 3 retry attempts with exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s)
- Jitter: Â±25% random variation
- Circuit breaker: Open after 5 consecutive failures, half-open after 30s
- Fallback: Return generic feedback when LLM services unavailable

### 4. LLM Response Schema Design

**Task**: Research schema design patterns for structured LLM responses

**Decision**: Use Zod schemas for runtime validation with clear error messages

**Rationale**:

- Zod provides TypeScript-first schema validation
- Runtime validation catches API response changes
- Clear error messages aid debugging
- Integrates well with existing project tooling

**Alternatives considered**:

- JSON Schema: More verbose and less TypeScript integration
- Manual validation: Error-prone and maintenance heavy
- No validation: Runtime errors and poor developer experience

**Implementation details**:

```typescript
const FeedbackResponseSchema = z.object({
  score: z.number().min(0).max(100),
  feedback: z.string().min(10).max(1000),
  strengths: z.array(z.string()).max(5),
  improvements: z.array(z.string()).max(5),
  timestamp: z.string().datetime()
});
```

### 5. Testing Strategies for LLM Services

**Task**: Research testing strategies for services that depend on external LLM APIs

**Decision**: Use dependency injection with mock implementations and contract testing

**Rationale**:

- Dependency injection enables easy mocking in unit tests
- Mock implementations provide predictable test data
- Contract testing ensures API compatibility
- Integration tests validate real API behavior

**Alternatives considered**:

- Real API calls in tests: Slow, unreliable, and expensive
- VCR-style recording: Complex setup and maintenance
- Stub services: Additional infrastructure complexity

**Implementation details**:

- Mock OpenAI clients for unit tests
- Test fixtures with realistic response data
- Contract tests for API schema validation
- Integration tests with test API keys (CI-safe)

### 6. Error Handling and Monitoring Integration

**Task**: Research error handling patterns for services with PostHog and Sentry integration

**Decision**: Use structured error types with context-aware logging and monitoring

**Rationale**:

- Structured errors provide better debugging information
- Context-aware logging helps trace issues across services
- PostHog tracks business events and user behavior
- Sentry captures technical errors with stack traces

**Alternatives considered**:

- Generic error logging: Insufficient context for debugging
- Separate monitoring tools: Increased complexity and cost
- No error tracking: Poor observability and debugging experience

**Implementation details**:

- Custom error types: `LLMServiceError`, `ValidationError`, `RetryExhaustedError`
- PostHog events: `llm_request_started`, `llm_request_completed`, `llm_request_failed`
- Sentry context: User ID, submission ID, retry count, API response codes
- Error boundaries for graceful degradation

## Research Summary

All technical unknowns have been resolved with concrete implementation decisions. The LLM Feedback Engine will use:

1. **OpenAI SDK** with structured error handling and retry logic
2. **Onion Architecture** with clear separation of concerns
3. **Exponential backoff** with circuit breaker patterns
4. **Zod schemas** for response validation
5. **Dependency injection** for testable design
6. **Structured error handling** with PostHog and Sentry integration

These decisions align with the project constitution and provide a robust, maintainable, and testable LLM service implementation.
