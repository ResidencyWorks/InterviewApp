# Tasks: Audio Upload for Drill Recordings

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/009-audio-upload-drill/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md ‚úì, spec.md ‚úì, research.md ‚úì, data-model.md ‚úì, contracts/ ‚úì

**Organization**: Tasks grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- [X] T016 [P] Setup PostHog analytics event logging utilities

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - user story implementation can now begin in parallel

---

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - Record and Upload Audio Response (Priority: P1) üéØ MVP

**Goal**: Core functionality enabling users to record audio and upload for evaluation

**Independent Test**: Record audio, verify upload completion, confirm successful storage without needing playback or evaluation features

**Mapping**: FR-001, FR-002, FR-003, FR-004, FR-006, FR-014, FR-015, FR-016 (core recording and upload functionality)

---

## Phase 4: User Story 2 - Fallback Text Input for Mic-Blocked States (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: Alternative input method when microphone permissions are denied or unavailable

**Independent Test**: Simulate microphone permission denial, verify text input functionality works independently

## Phase 5: User Story 3 - Monitor Upload Progress with Retry (Priority: P3)

**Goal**: Enhanced UX with progress tracking and automatic retry for failed uploads

**Independent Test**: Simulate network failures, verify retry behavior and progress updates work independently

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-5)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories CAN proceed in parallel once Foundational is complete
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 ‚Üí P2 ‚Üí P3)
- **Signed URL (Phase 6)**: Depends on User Story 1 completion (upload needs to work first)
- **Polish (Phase 7)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - May integrate with US1 but should be independently testable
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Requires US1 to be functional for progress tracking context

### Within Each User Story

- Core implementation before integration
- Service layer before API routes
- Components depend on service layer
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (T003, T006-T009)
- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (T011, T012, T013, T015, T016)
- Once Foundational phase completes, User Stories 1-3 can start in parallel (if team capacity allows)
- Within User Story 1: T017, T018, T021 can run in parallel
- Within User Story 2: T027 can run in parallel
- Within User Story 3: T035 can run in parallel
- Polish phase tests (T054-T056, T057-T058) can run in parallel

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup (Supabase bucket, database, dependencies)
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (models, services, validation)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (record and upload audio)
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently
5. Deploy/demo if ready

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (MVP!)
3. Add User Story 2 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
4. Add User Story 3 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
5. Add Signed URL playback ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
6. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1 (core upload)
   - Developer B: User Story 2 (fallback text input)
   - Developer C: User Story 3 (progress & retry)
   - Developer D: Signed URL generation (Phase 6)
3. Stories complete and integrate independently
4. All developers participate in Polish phase testing

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability (US1, US2, US3)
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Verify task completion before moving to dependent tasks
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Total: 65 tasks organized across 7 phases
- MVP scope: Phases 1-3 (T001-T026, approximately 26 tasks)
- Full feature scope: All phases (T001-T065, 65 tasks)
- Parallel opportunities: ~30 tasks can run in parallel across different team members
